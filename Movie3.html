		<span class="auto-style13"><span class="auto-style16">In a small town, Charlie 
		Bucket, a poor paperboy, watches a group of children visit a candy shop. 
		Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious 
		tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem "The 
		Fairies", and tells Charlie, "Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes 
		out." Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden 
		grandparents. After telling Grandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe reveals 
		that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including 
		rival Mr. Slug worth, sent in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka 
		disappeared, but after three years resumed selling candy; the origin of 
		Wonka's labor force is unknown.</span></span><span class="auto-style14"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN" class="auto-style15">The 
		next day, Wonka announces that he hid five "Golden Tickets" in chocolate 
		Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a 
		lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by the 
		gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the gum-chewing 
		Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed Mike Teevee. As each 
		winner is announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two 
		Wonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket. The newspapers announce the fifth 
		ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay causing Charlie to lose 
		hope. The next day, Charlie finds money in a sewer and uses it to buy a 
		Scrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys another Wonka Bar for 
		Joe. Walking home, as Charlie hears people reading the newspapers; 
		revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is a fake, he opens 
		the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While rushing home, he 
		encounters the same man seen whispering to the other winners, who 
		introduces himself as Arthur Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample 
		of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN" class="auto-style13">
		<span class="auto-style16">Returning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Joe as his 
		chaperone. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them 
		inside where each sign a contract before the tour. The factory includes 
		a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other 
		sweets and inventions. As the visitor’s sample these, they see Wonka's 
		workers, small men known as Oompa-Loompas. Augustus falls into the 
		chocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the 
		Inventing Room, everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet 
		becomes a large blueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a 
		three-course meal, over Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy 
		Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Joe ignore Wonka's warning and 
		sample the drinks. They float and have a near-fatal encounter with an 
		exhaust fan before burping back to the ground. In the Chocolate Eggs 
		Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a 
		garbage chute leading to the furnace, with her father falling in trying 
		to rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's Wonka vision, only for Mike 
		to teleport himself and become a few inches tall.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">
		<span class="auto-style15">With Charlie and Joe remaining, Wonka says 
		they are not getting anything because they violated the contract by 
		stealing the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Infuriated by this, Joe suggests to 
		Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but 
		Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka. With this selfless act, Wonka 
		declares Charlie as the winner. He reveals that Slugworth is Mr. 
		Wilkinson, a fellow employee of Wonka, and the offer to buy the 
		Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed. The trio enter 
		the "Wonkavator", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of 
		the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize 
		is the factory; Wonka created the contest to find an heir worthy enough, 
		and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then 
		reminds Charlie not to forget about the man who suddenly received 
		everything he ever wanted. Charlie asks, "What happened?" to which Wonka 
		replies, "He lived happily ever after.</span><strong>"<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>
