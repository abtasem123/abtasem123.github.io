<br />
</span><span class="auto-style10">Billy Hoyle (Harrelson) is a former Tulane 
basketball player who makes his living by hustling streetballers who assume he 
cannot play well because he is white. Billy never degrades his race when joining 
on pickup games; he simply allows his opponents, most of whom are black, to 
falsely believe they have a natural advantage over him due to his race and 
clothing style. Such a player is Sidney Deane (Snipes), a talented but cocky 
player who is beaten twice by Billy; once in a half court team game and later in 
a one-on-one shootout for mone</span><br class="auto-style10" />
<span class="auto-style4">Billy sings Gloria a song he has composed and wins her 
back. As Billy and Gloria discuss their new future, this time it is Sidney who 
is desperate for Billy's help; his apartment was burglarized and his winnings 
stolen, so he and Rhonda are desperate for money so they can move to a better 
neighborhood. Gloria is expecting Billy to get a steady job and settle down, but 
Sidney informs him that two hoops legends of the L.A. streetball scene, "The 
King" and "The Duck", are playing at the courts downtown. Sidney asks Billy to 
partner with him in playing against them and Billy enthusiastically agrees, 
offering to gamble his share of Gloria's take. Gloria warns that if Billy 
gambles with her money, they are through. Billy, feeling he must honor the 
obligation he owes Sidney for getting Gloria on </span>
<span class="auto-style12">Jeopardy!</span><span class="auto-style4"> in the 
first place, sides with Sidney. They play a final game against King and Duck. In 
a very tight game, Sidney and Billy prevail, the winning point coming when 
Sidney lobs an "alley-oop" pass to Billy, who dunks it.<br />
<br />
Returning home happy for having doubled the share that Gloria gave him of her 
winnings, Billy discovers Gloria has kept her word and left him for good, and is 
crushed. The mobsters who are after Billy track him down, and he pays off his 
debts. Realizing that Gloria has left him for good, Billy asks Sidney to set him 
up with a real job. Sidney remarks that Billy and Gloria may be better off 
without each other.Some time later, Billy and Sidney continue their partnership. 
The film ends with Billy and Sidney launching into another basketball argument, 
but this time, as friends.<br />
